\section{Prioritized Recommendations}

\subsection{Cross-Experiment Effort}

This section presents priority recommendations that the working group
gives to the HEP-FCE with an understanding that they are of interest
to funding entities.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The goals of the HEP Software Foundation\cite{hsfweb} (HSF) are
  largely overlapping with HEP-FCE.  The two groups can be mutually
  beneficial.  HSF is forming a general, grassroots organization while
  HEP-FCE potentially can fund specifically targeted efforts.  HSF can
  be a source of requirements, working groups, review panels, project
  proposals and expertise all of which HEP-FCE can beneficially
  leverage to carry out its goals.  It is recommended that HEP-FCE
  continue to participate in HSF formation activities and look into
  how the two groups might partner on specific actions.

\item Various detailed ``opportunities'' listed in the following
  survey sections call out the need for further work to be carried out
  in some detail by technical working groups. These are needed to
  better understand the nature of a specific problem shared across
  many experiments, formulate requirements for and in some cases
  design and implement solutions.  The HEP-FCE should organize such
  working groups from suitable expertise from the HEP software community.

\end{enumerate}


\subsection{Effort by Experiments}

Throughout the following survey sections, a number of best practices
and pitfalls relevant to the development and use of software libraries
and tools by individual experiments were identified.

\begin{enumerate}

\item New experiments should not underestimate the importance of
  software to their success.  It should be treated as a major
  subsystem at least on part with other important aspects such as
  detector design, DAQ/electronics, civil construction, etc.

\item Experiments should understand the pitfalls listed in
  section~\ref{subsec:pitfalls}).  New ones should implement ways to
  avoid them and existing ones should reflect on if they apply and
  develop ways to address them.  Likewise the best practices listed in
  section~\ref{subsec:bestpractices}) should be considered.  New
  experiments should attempt to follow them and if practical and
  beneficial, existing experiments should seek to make changes to
  implement them.

\item New and existing experiments should join the effort to organize
  and otherwise supply representative members to the HEP Software
  Foundation.

\end{enumerate}
