\section{Prioritized Recommendations}

\textit{(autors: anders, brett, all)}

\textit{Editing notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give a prioritized list of activities that will best help address the identified problems in the previous section. 
\item Give endorsement of HEP Software Foundation (?)
\item This section should then largely be a summary of the recommendations that are part of each survey area.
\end{itemize}
