\section{Prioritized Recommendations}

\fixme{(authors: anders, brett, all)}

\textit{Editing notes:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Give a prioritized list of activities that will best help address the identified problems in the previous section. 
\item Give endorsement of HEP Software Foundation (?)
\item This section should then largely be a summary of the recommendations that are part of each survey area.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{General Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Perform an initial survey of the current state of the art for software tools and systems at the beginning of a new experiment.
\item Layout a datamodel schema up front
\item Design for unit testing of Application software modules outside of framework
\item Design broad-enough namespace rules (unique filenames, versions of code and data files) up front
\end{itemize}
