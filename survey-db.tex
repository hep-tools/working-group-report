\subsection{Databases}

\begin{itemize}
\item Tech arguments, make some collection of unbiased facts to judge suitability (is it possible?)
\item Focus on conditions database as one particularly cross-experiment component and make this clear to avoid confusion.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MINOS's ``DBI'' adopted by other neutrino experiments
  \item BaBar/Atlas/LHCb's similar
  \item DB schema, fixed parts + experiment-specific parts
  \end{itemize}
\item Note that configuration DB (eg. for configuring the experiment DAQ) may be too experiment-specific to provide one solution
  \begin{itemize}
  \item however, system to sink+emit alarms/messages from disparate providers to disparate consumers would be generally useful (``XMLBlaster'' is one example toolkit)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
