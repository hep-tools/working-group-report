\begin{itemize}
\item Tech arguments, make some collection of unbiased facts to judge suitability (is it possible?)

	Essentially all experiments will use one or more databases to
	store their data (or pointers to the data), as well as provenance 
	information and metadata.  The requirements for these databases will
	vary widely across the range of possible experiments, as will
	requirements for access (read and write) to different databases.  
	We focus here on the possibility of each experiment presenting
	to its collaboration a 'Conditions Database' interface, which
	provides a common (primarily read) access interface to universal
	information that is widely needed by the collaboration.

	Examples of this information might be:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item database table list, DB schema
	\item event catalog parameter description, schema
	\item high level experiment run catalog
	\item high level experiment event catalog
	\item high level data processing runs catalog
	\end{itemize}

	One can imaging that query access to such common information be
	available in a uniform fashion to facilitate, for instance,
	automated lookup of DB schema.  

\item Focus on conditions database as one particularly cross-experiment component and make this clear to avoid confusion.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MINOS's ``DBI'' adopted by other neutrino experiments
  \item BaBar/Atlas/LHCb's similar
  \item DB schema, fixed parts + experiment-specific parts
  \end{itemize}
\item Note that configuration DB (eg. for configuring the experiment DAQ) may be too experiment-specific to provide one solution
  \begin{itemize}
  \item however, system to sink+emit alarms/messages from disparate providers to disparate consumers would be generally useful (``XMLBlaster'' is one example toolkit)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Description}

Every HEP experiment has some form of ``conditions database''. The purpose of such as database is to capture and store any information that is needed in order to interpret or simulate events taken by the DAQ system. The underlying principle behind such a database is that the ``conditions'' at the time an event is acquired vary significantly slower that that the quantities read out by the DAQ in the event itself. The period over which these condition quantities can change range from seconds to the lifetime of the experiment.

In implementing a conditions database, an experiment is providing a mechanism by which to associate an event to a set of conditions without having to save a complete copy of those conditions with every event. A secondary feature is that the event-to-conditions association can normally be configured to select a particular version of the conditions as knowledge about the conditions can change over time as they are better understood.
