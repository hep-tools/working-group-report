\section{Vision Statement}

The working group's vision of what we would like to see in a Forum for
Computational Excellence.

\begin{itemize}
\item Emphasize this vision is for advisory/recommendation purposes and not  ``binding''
\item This can be a short section
\item Include any desires for how the FCE operates, interacts with the community, publicity, communication, funding, lobbying, encourages, what else?
\end{itemize}
