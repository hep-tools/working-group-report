\section{Data Management}
\label{data}

\fixme{(authors: Anders, Brian, Maxim, Mike, Simon)}

\subsection{Definition}
Data Management is any content neutral interaction with the data and includes Data Storage/Archival, Access, 
Distribution and Curation. It includes technical solutions, procedures and policies and deals with the full life 
cycle of the data. 



\subsubsection{Metadata}
To be able to manage the data it has to be described. Metadata is therefore a necessary part of data management. The 
list of possible metadata is long, but a few key ones are 'Data provenance' and 'Data file location' since they map onto 
applications like file managers and data catalogs and their possible ties to workflow management.

\subsubsection{Data catalogs And Logical Data Sets}
A data catalog combines a file catalog i.e. information about where the data files are stored, with additional metadata.
This enables the construction of logical (virtual) data sets and makes it possible for users to make a selection of a 
subset of the available data.

\begin{description}
\item[Fermi Data Catalog] One way to do this is to register all the metadata when you register the file. A slightly
different approach was chosen by the Fermi Space Telescope Data Catalog. In addition to the initial metadata, it had a
data crawler that would go through all registered files and extract metadata like number of events etc. The advantage is
that the set of metadata then can be easily expanded after the fact - you just let loose the crawler with the new list
of quantities to extract. It should be noted that the Fermi Data Catalog is independent of any workflow 
management system (so any processing metadata will have to be explicitly added), but can be chained together with 
the Fermi workflow engine ('pipeline') to easily produce user defined skims i.e. the user selects cuts and what 
logical data sets to use and the relevant file locations are automatically forwarded to the processing pipeline that 
produce the requested output files and make them avaialble for download by the user.

\item[SAM] [more detailed description - SAM is more tied into workflow management than the Fermi Data catalog]

\item[ATLAS] ....

\item[CMS] ....

\end{description}


\subsubsection{File Catalogs and Federated Storage/XRootD}
One interesting evolution is the use of XRootD and Federated Storage. A traditional file catalog will contain the 
location of the data files. With XRootD the notion of location is outsourced to the XRootD director.

\subsubsection{Editing notes}

\fixme{This is not a real section and will be deleted}

\begin{itemize}
\item Define data management and it's major elements (one suggestion is below)
\item reference that it is related to workflow management
\item List ways that DM can tend to be particularly parochial and how in some cases it must be specifically tailored to the computing facility and/or experiment.
\item List what elements are general.
\item Take care not to overlap with the systems group, but to point out where there are areas of overlap.
\end{itemize}
Possible partitioning of DM into smaller parts:
\begin{description}
\item[Distribution] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item authentication/authorization
  \item caching / purging
  \item side hardware and software requirements
  \item on-demand vs. scheduled
  \end{itemize}
\item[Metadata] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What job produced what file and with what input parameters/data
  \item Where is my file? Data catalogs ...
  \item Fileset definitions
  \item File popularity to drive cache purges
  \item Important analysis summary info
  \item Locating files/events/objects
  \item Everything as metadata
  \item Provenance tracking
  \item Namespace issues
  \end{itemize}
\end{description}
