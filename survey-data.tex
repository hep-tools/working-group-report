\subsection{Data}

This problem space can be partitioned in more than one way.  The
components of are necessarily coupled.  Some general parts and their
interfaces.

Beware of mission creep.  This problem area (and software dev) is particularly easy to fall into parochial solutions.

Speaking of mission creep, we have to be careful not to overlap with the ``Systems'' group.

\item[Processing] issues:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Submission tools:
  \item Running multiple instances of a job differing only by parameters or input files
  \item Running jobs in parallel on local batch or wider Grid
  \end{itemize}
\item[Distribution] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item authentication/authorization
  \item caching / purging
  \item side hardware and software requirements
  \item on-demand vs. scheduled
  \end{itemize}
\item[Monitoring] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Overall health, throughput, usage, abuse
  \item Locating and understanding failures
  \item Determining systemic problems
  \item Drilling down to details at the level of individual jobs
  \end{itemize}
\item[Recovery] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item rerun failed jobs
  \item clean up droppings
  \item fix systemic problems
  \end{itemize}
\item[Meta data] issues:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item What job produced what file and with what input parameters/data
  \item Where is my file?
  \item Fileset definitions
  \item File popularity to drive cache purges
  \item Important analysis summary info
  \item Locating files/events/objects
  \item Everything as metadata
  \end{itemize}
