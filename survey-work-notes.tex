\subsubsection{Notes on content}

\begin{itemize}
\item -mxp- there is workflow mgt and workload mgt. While they overlap at times, and also include varying degree of data management functionality, it is best to make this distinction (also based on existing literature). For that reason, I changed the title of the section.
\item -mxp- Overlap with Data Management.
\item -mxp- DIRAC, PanDA, CRAB3/ Phedex.

\end{itemize}
