\section{Introduction}

\textit{(autors: anders, brett, all)}

Largely lifted from the ``strawman'' document
\begin{itemize}
\item What is FCE
\item What is this working group
\item Scope and charge
\item any interpretations/clarifications
\item define terms: ``libs/tools'' (suitable abbrev for later repeating? ``L/T''?), ``cross-experiment'' (avoid ``cross-cutting''?)
\item ``We will illustrate how the development process, community, promotion, etc, plays a role in successful libs/tools cross-experiment projects.''
\item Finish with overview of what the rest of the document will contain
\end{itemize}
